# global_planner
a modified global_planner based on the global_planner of ROS navigation stack including A*, Hybrid A* and Voronoi_planner. <br>
the planner is registered as "global_planner/YTPlanner", so "global_planner/GlobalPlanner" should be modified as "global_planner/YTPlanner" in the launch file of move_base
